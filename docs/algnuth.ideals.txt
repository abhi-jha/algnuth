    algnuth.ideals

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides functions to manipulate
    extension fields given their minimal polynomial.

FUNCTIONS
    factorIdeals(P)
        Finds the ideals of the ring of integers
        of the algebraic number field whose
        minimal polynomial is P
    
    factorial(...)
        factorial(x) -> Integral
        
        Find x!. Raise a ValueError if x is negative or non-integral.
    
    idealsContaining(P, p)
        Ideals of the extension field of minimal
        polynomial P containing the prime p
    
    minkowski_bound(P)
        Any ideal of the ring of integers
        of the algebraic number field whose
        minimal polynomial is P contains
        an integer N such that
        1 ≤ N ≤ minkowski_bound(P)
